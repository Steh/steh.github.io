# Integrating API Data into Cribl

## Step 1: Set Up Event Breaker

1. **Download Data**: Obtain the data from your source in a compatible format. [Refer to Cribl Documentation][1]
2. **Create Event Breaker**: Use Cribl to create an Event Breaker, segmenting data into events with custom rules. [Event Breaker Guide][6]
3. **Upload & Configure**: Upload data to Cribl and define event rules. Save your configuration. [Configuration Guide][2]

## Step 2: Configure REST Input

1. **Schedule API Queries**: Set up daily queries to sources like the NVD. Enter the API URL with quotes. [Scheduling API Queries][8]
2. **Link Event Breaker**: Assign the Event Breaker to the REST input for seamless data processing. [Linking Guide][3]
3. **Finalize Setup**: Ensure Cribl automatically queries and processes data per your rules. [Finalizing Setup][4]

## Tips
