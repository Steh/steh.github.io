# Overview

**IT** (Information Technology): Information systems and networks  
**OT** (Operational Technology): Systems controlling and monitoring physical processes  
- PLCs, SCADA, DCS  
**IoT**: Connected devices  
**ICS**: Industrial control systems  
Embedded devices

## Purdue Model for ICS/OT

The Purdue Model segments ICS/OT into zones and levels to manage risk:

- **Enterprise Zone**: Business IT systems  
- **DMZ**: Isolates enterprise and control networks  
- **Control System Zone**: Process control and automation

### Purdue Model Levels

- **Level 3**: Site operations (production, planning, ERP integration)
- **Level 2**: Supervisory control (SCADA, HMI, site-wide monitoring)
- **Level 1**: Process control (PLCs, RTUs, direct control logic)
- **Level 0**: Physical process (sensors, actuators, field devices)

## SCADA vs DCS

### SCADA

Centralized, often geographically distributed, real-time monitoring and control.  
- Components: HMI, RTUs/PLCs, supervisory servers, network  
- Risks: Weak authentication, exposed interfaces, protocol vulnerabilities

### DCS

Localized, high-reliability process automation (e.g., plants, refineries).  
- Components: Operator workstations, control servers, field controllers, network  
- Risks: Insider threats, targeted malware, network disruption

## Security & Incident Response

- Map assets, protocols, and data flows
- Collaborate with OT engineers
- Prioritize safety and uptime
- Use OT-aware monitoring and segmentation
- Tailor incident response plans for OT/ICS
- Regularly test with tabletop exercises
- Monitor for anomalies and leverage ICS threat intelligence
