## The Purdue Model for ICS/OT 
is a framework for organizing industrial control systems (ICS) and operational technology (OT) into different zones and layers based on the level of risk and security needed.

At the highest level, there are three main zones in the Purdue Model:

    The Enterprise Zone
    The DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)
    The Control System Zone

    Level 0 — The physical process — Defines the actual physical processes.
    Level 1 — Intelligent devices — Sensing and manipulating the physical processes. Process sensors, analyzers, actuators and related instrumentation.
    Level 2 — Control systems — Supervising, monitoring and controlling the physical processes. Real-time controls and software; DCS, human-machine interface (HMI); supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software.
    Level 3 – Site operation

Level 3 encompasses the systems responsible for managing site operations, such as production planning, scheduling, and performance monitoring. These systems often integrate with business-level applications, like enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and may be connected to the corporate IT network.

Level 2 – Supervisory Control

Level 2 includes the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and other systems responsible for monitoring and controlling processes at a site or facility level. These systems provide operators with real-time visibility into process conditions and enable them to adjust control settings as needed.

Level 1 – Process Control

Level 1 comprises the field-level devices directly controlling the physical processes at Level 0, such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and remote terminal units (RTUs). These devices receive input signals from Level 0 components and execute control logic to maintain desired process conditions, like temperature or flow rate.

Level 0 – Physical Process

Level 0 of the Purdue Model represents the physical process or equipment controlled within an ICS environment, such as valves, pumps, motors, and sensors. These components convert physical inputs, like temperature or pressure, into electrical signals that control systems can process.

## SCADA and DCS

Architecture

A typical SCADA system consists of the following components:

Human-Machine Interface (HMI): A graphical interface that allows operators to visualize and interact with the SCADA system.
Remote terminal units (RTUs) or programmable logic controllers (PLCs): Devices that interface with field equipment and translate sensor data into a format the SCADA system can process.
Supervisory system: A central server that gathers data from RTUs or PLCs and processes it to make decisions or send commands back to the field devices.
Communication infrastructure: The network connects the HMI, RTUs/PLCs, and supervisory system, enabling data exchange and command transmission.
Security considerations

SCADA systems were initially designed for functionality and reliability, with security often taking a back seat. As a result, they are vulnerable to various attacks, including:

Impact

    Unauthorized access to the HMI, potentially allowing attackers to issue false commands or manipulate data.
    Compromise of RTUs or PLCs, leading to unauthorized control of field equipment.
    Disruption or manipulation of communication infrastructure, potentially causing loss of visibility or control.

DCS

Distributed Control Systems (DCS) are used in environments that require high levels of process control and automation, such as chemical plants, refineries, and manufacturing facilities. DCS systems are designed to manage complex processes with multiple interconnected control loops and are more focused on local control as opposed to the geographically dispersed nature of SCADA systems.
Architecture

A typical DCS architecture consists of the following components:

Operator workstations: Human-machine interfaces that allow operators to monitor and control the process.
Control servers: Centralized servers responsible for processing control logic and managing the control loops.
Field controllers: Devices that interface with field equipment and execute the control logic received from the control servers.
Communication infrastructure: The network connecting operator workstations, control servers, and field controllers.
Security considerations

While DCS systems are generally more secure than SCADA systems due to their closed and proprietary nature, they're still vulnerable to various attacks. Key security concerns include:
Impact

    Unauthorized access to operator workstations, potentially allowing attackers to manipulate the process.
    Compromise of control servers or field controllers, leading to unauthorized control or disruption of the process.
    Disruption or manipulation of communication infrastructure, potentially causing loss of visibility or control.

Incident response in SCADA and DCS environments

When responding to incidents in SCADA and DCS environments, consider the following best practices:

    Develop a thorough understanding of the environment, including the architecture, communication protocols, and critical assets.
    Establish and maintain close collaboration with OT engineers and operators, as they have valuable knowledge and experience with the systems in question.
    Prioritize the safety and reliability of the system, as incidents in these environments can have significant real-world consequences, such as environmental damage or loss of life.
    Utilize specialized tools and techniques for OT and ICS environments, as traditional IT security tools may not be suitable or effective.
    Implement network segmentation and access controls to limit the potential impact of an incident and reduce the attack surface.
    Develop tailored incident response plans for SCADA and DCS environments, addressing unique challenges and considerations such as specialized skill sets, communication protocols, and regulatory requirements.
    Conduct regular tabletop exercises and simulations to test the effectiveness of your incident response plans and ensure that your team is prepared to handle incidents in these environments.
    Continuously monitor the environment for signs of compromise, leveraging ICS-specific threat intelligence and anomaly detection techniques.
