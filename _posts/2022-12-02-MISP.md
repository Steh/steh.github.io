MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) is an open-source threat information platform that facilitates the collection, storage, and distribution of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) related to malware, cyber attacks, financial fraud, or any intelligence within a community of trusted members[^1].

## MISP Terms

**Events**: Collections of contextually linked information, representing specific incidents or occurrences.

**Attributes**: Individual data points associated with an event, such as network or system indicators.

**Objects**: Custom attribute compositions.

**Object References**: Relationships between different objects.

**Sightings**: Time-specific occurrences of a given data point or attribute detected to provide more credibility.

**Tags**: Labels attached to events/attributes.

**Taxonomies**: Classification libraries used to tag, classify, and organize information. Taxonomies provide a standardized framework for categorizing and labeling threat intelligence. Examples include:

- **MISP Galaxy**: A knowledge base that provides a comprehensive set of threat intelligence items, including threat actors, tools, vulnerabilities, and more. It enables analysts to label events and attributes with relevant contextual information from the galaxy.

- **Industry-Specific Taxonomies**: Custom taxonomies tailored to specific industries, such as finance, healthcare, or energy. These taxonomies help organizations focus on relevant threats and indicators specific to their sector.

- **MITRE ATT&CK**: A widely used taxonomy that describes adversary behavior and techniques across the cyber kill chain. It provides a standardized framework for understanding and categorizing the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed by threat actors.

**Indicators**: Pieces of information that can detect suspicious or malicious cyber activity.
