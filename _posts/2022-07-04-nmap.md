## active vs. passive scanning

* **passive scanning**:
  * "involves scanning a network without directly interacting with the target device"[^1]
  * "is usually carried out through packet capture and analysis tools like Wireshark"[^1]
* **active scanning**:
  * " is a scanning method whereby you scan individual endpoints in an IT network to retrieve more detailed information"
  * "active scan involves sending packets or queries directly to specific asshow to scann

## nmap scanning technics

* TCP Connect Scans (*-sTi*)
  * default setting when run **without** sudo permission
  * "performing the three-way handshake with each target port"[^2]
  * Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the service is open by the response it receives
* SYN Scans (*-sS*)
  * default setting when run **with** sudo permission
  * sometimes referred to as "Half-open" scans, or "Stealth" scans.
  * after getting the SYN/ACK Package from the Target the Client send a RST (Reset) Package
  * that resets the connection and for the target the connection is not fully established
  * significantly faster than a standard TCP Connect scan
  * disadvantage:
    * unstable services are sometimes brought down by SYN scans
    * need sudo permissions
* UDP Scans (*-sU*)
  * sends a UDP Packet to a Port
  * when there is no response the port will be considerd as "open|filtered"
  * when there is a ICMP response with the message that the port is unreachable the port will be marked as closed
  * much slower than TCP Scans

## scanning techniques

```bash
#-sC: Performs a script scan using the default set of scripts.
#-sV: Enables version detection, which will detect what versions are running on what port.
nmap -sC -sV xx.xx.xx.xx

## ping scan to find active hosts
### is to obtain a "map" of the network structure
nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24

## OS Scan
nmap -O xx.xx.xx.xx

## Detecting Services
nmap -sV xx.xx.xx.xx
```

## Paramter

```conf
# basic scan types
-sT     TCP Connect Scans
-sS     SYN "Half-open" Scans
-sU     UDP Scans 

-Pn     disable the ping scan host will always be treated as alive
-f      fragment the packets making it less likely that the packets will be detected by a firewall or IDS

-oG     grepable output

-sV     Version Detection
-O      OS detection

-oN     normal output to a file

-sC                     default scripts
--script=<categorie>    use scripts from categorie

-p-     scan all ports
```

## Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

* is writen in lua an can do powerfull things
* some useful catefories:
  * safe:- Won't affect the target
  * intrusive:- Not safe: likely to affect the target
  * vuln:- Scan for vulnerabilities
  * exploit:- Attempt to exploit a vulnerability
  * auth:- Attempt to bypass authentication for running services (e.g. Log into an FTP server anonymously)
  * brute:- Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services
  * discovery:- Attempt to query running services for further information about the network (e.g. query an SNMP server).
* [list of all categories](https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html)
* [help for the scripts](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/)

```conf
# examples for scripts
--script=safe
--script=vuln
--script=smb-enum-users,smb-enum-shares

# using scripts with arguments
nmap -p 80 --script http-put --script-args http-put.url='/dav/shell.php',http-put.file='./shell.php'

# built in help
nmap --script-help <script-name>
```

### finding scripts

* [nmap website](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/)
* Filesystem

```bash
ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*ftp*
grep "safe" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db

```

### install/update scripts

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap

sudo wget -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/<script-name>.nse
nmap --script-updatedb
```
