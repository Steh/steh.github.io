excerpt: "Lynis is a security auditing tool for Unix-based systems. Its reports provide information about the system's security posture, including potential vulnerabilities and configuration issues. The report will typically include a summary of the findings, as well as detailed information about each check that was performed. It is important to review the report carefully and take appropriate action to address any issues that are identified."
