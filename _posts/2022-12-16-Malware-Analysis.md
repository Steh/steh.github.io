## Dangers of Analysing Malware Samples

**WARNING: Handling a malware sample is dangerous. Always consider precautions while analysing it.**[^1]

* Always assume that malware samples will infect your device; hence executing it is not always the first and only step in analysing it.
* Only run the malware sample in a controlled environment that prevents potential compromise of unwanted assets.
* It is always recommended to have your sandbox, which allows you have a worry-free execution of malware samples.

## Two Methodes of Analysis

* Static Analysis[^1]
  * analysing a malware sample without executing the code
  * analysing the binarys and searching for strings
  * Tools:
    * Strings
    * [Detect It Easy (DIE)](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy)
    * CAPA detects capabilities in executable files
      * if malware is packed try to unpack with upx and CAPA again
* Dynamic Analysis[^1]
  * understanding the malware by executing it in a safe environment
  * Tools:
    * [ProcMon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) a Windows tool that shows real-time registry, file system, and process/thread activity
      * Start Application and filter for Processname like ...exe
